This project is the senior capstone of Burson Yang and Laura Lehoczki of NYUSH class of 2019
Our project topic and objective was to solve the automated data conversion, database management and data analysis of one of  Thyssenkrupp's Shanghai plants (PHS).

Functionality and usage:
- visualize_from_db.py: creates the correlation graph for new data in the database since the last analysis
  - Open command line on Windows
  - Drag and drop the script or insert path to script into command line
  - Graphs will be generated in the Analysis folder
  
- Machines.sql: creates the tables of interest in the database
  - No need to run it again, but if tables need to be recreated, follow instructions in the header of the script
